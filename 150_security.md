#Workshop 150: Secure Your System#

**Level:** Beginner; **Duration:** 35–40 minutes

The platform makes it easy for you to implement a security policy of least privilege for all types of users. Effectively, each user should only have the privileges they need to get the job done. Every organization is locked down tightly when you first provision it. These tutorials teach you how to use various features such as users, profiles, permission sets, and roles to progressively open up access so that just the right users have access to just the right data at just the right time.

Here’s a preview of how it’s done.

1. **Create profiles and permission sets **— Identify the different types of users you need for your application, based on the different functions each type needs to access. Create a base level profile for each type of user such that each profile has only the permissions required for that type of user to perform these functions. Then create permission sets to handle exceptions—situations in which a user may need a few more permissions.
2. **Create users **— For each person who needs app and database access, create a user, assigning the user to the appropriate profile and permission sets.
3. **Set sharing models **— For each object, set the organization-wide default record sharing model to determine whether the records that each user owns are public or private.
4. **Share private records **— Use roles, groups, record sharing rules, and other means to share private records with other users.

Browser Switching

This tutorial requires you to switch between users. To do that, it’s easier to leave one browser open as your admin/developer (the login you’ve been using so far), and use a different browser for other users. For example, if you are using Safari for your admin/developer login, use a different browser such as Mozilla Firefox for the Manager and Salesperson users. That way, you can simply switch between different browsers to configure security and then test record access without having to log out and log in repeatedly. If you’re using Google Chrome, you can also use Chrome _incognito_ to log in as multiple users in the same browser.
