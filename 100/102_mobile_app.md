#Access the App from a Mobile Device#

**Level:** Beginner; **Duration:** 5–10 minutes

The simple app you created is already accessible as a mobile app. What? Truly! Most things you create in Salesforce are available via a mobile device, giving your users full access to the information they need, no matter where they are. As you continue to develop in this workbook, everything you do in the full site is reflected in the Salesforce1 mobile app.

For the warehouse use case, you can imagine workers in a warehouse typically need to make a physical check of the inventory. Rather than lug around a laptop or transfer data by pen and paper, they can update on the go, right on the phone. This in turn might be useful to a service technician on the road, who can instantly see which products are and aren’t available.

##Step 1: Set Up Mobile Access##

There are two ways to access Salesforce1: using a downloadable app or a mobile browser app. First, you need to be able to access Salesforce1:

- To use the downloadable app, use your mobile device’s browser to go to www.salesforce.com/mobile, select the appropriate platform, and download Salesforce1. 
- To enable the mobile browser app, from Setup click **Mobile Administration &gt; Salesforce1**, and then **Enable the Salesforce mobile browser app**. Now, when you navigate to login.salesforce.com from your mobile browser, Salesforce will recognize that you’re working from a mobile device and redirect you to the Salesforce1 mobile browser app. 

1. Open Salesforce1 from your mobile device.
2. Enter your Salesforce credentials and tap Log in to Salesforce.

The downloadable mobile app is usually preferable because the following features aren’t supported in the mobile browser app.

- **Today **helps users plan for and manage their day by integrating calendar events from their mobile device with their Salesforce tasks, contacts, and accounts. 
- **Push notifications **alert users to important things when they aren’t using the app.   

##Step 2: Try Out the Mobile App##

1. Tap the hamburger.
2. Tap More...
3. Tap **Merchandise**.
2. You can easily create a new piece of merchandise from the mobile device. Tap **New.**
2. Name it *E–reader*, and then tap **Save**.

**Tell Me More....**

You probably noticed that unlike the full Salesforce site, there isn’t a Home tab, and there doesn’t appear to be a Warehouse app. Additionally, it took some effort to find the Merchandise tab. Why is that?

- Each tab is represented through a menu item in the Recent section of the Salesforce1 navigation menu. Since your app’s Merchandise tab is new, it doesn’t appear on the **Recent** section yet until you start using it. After you’ve used the app a bit, the default tabs (account, case, etc.) are replaced by the tabs you use most frequently. 
- Salesforce apps, such as the Sales app or a your custom Warehouse app, don’t appear in Salesforce1, because the mobile app figures out which _records _you look at most often. Rather than using the Force.com app menu to customize the tabs a user sees regularly, the smart search items under the **Recent** section reorder based on the user’s history of recent objects. 
- Don’t get the idea that the layout and navigation are entirely dynamic. You can customize the fields, actions, apps, and the navigation of virtually the entire mobile app. You’ll get into that in later tutorials.   

##Step 3: Explore the Mobile App##

You get a lot of functionality out of the box with Salesforce1. Take a moment to explore what’s there. 

1. You should still be on the detail page for your new merchandise item. You can Edit, Clone, or Delete this record from its _detail page_.
2. Swipe left and you’ll see there’s a page for activities related to this item. This is the _related information page_.
3. Swipe right from the detail view and you’ll see there’s a blank page for the feed. There will be feed items here just as soon as you make some changes. 
4. Tap publisher icon and notice there are icons that represent actions. This area is called the _publisher_. Swipe left to expose more actions.
5. Try out an action by tapping **Post.**
6. Enter some text, such as *Adding an e-reader to inventory* and then tap **Share**. You can automatically see the  
post you created in the feed for the e-reader. Anyone who follows that item will get updates for it.
7. Tap icon, and this time tap New Task.
8. In Subject, type *Enter a price*, and for Due Date, tap the calendar and choose **Today.**
9. Tap **Submit.**
10. From the detail page, swipe left and tap Open Activities, and you’ll see the task you created for yourself.

As you can see, you get the same functionality from the mobile app as you do in the full site—just the controls and navigation are different.

**Tell Me More....**

- In the related information page you saw activities listed, and you might be wondering if you can add other related things. Yes! You can add notes, attachments, and _mobile cards _to this page, which you’ll get to later. 
- You saw a number of things you can do from the action tray, such as create a post, log a call, create a case, and so on. Of course you can add and remove items from the tray and rearrange the order. This is all done in the page layout editor and is covered in later lessons.
