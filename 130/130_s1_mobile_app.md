#About the Salesforce1 Mobile App Workbook#

While you can use the Salesforce platform to build virtually any kind of app, most apps share certain characteristics, such as:

- A database to model the information in the app 
- A user interface to expose data and functionality to those logged into your app 
- Business logic and workflow to carry out particular tasks under certain conditions   

In addition, apps developed on the Salesforce Platform automatically support: 

- A mobile app that is easy to use, customize, and further develop 
- A public website to allow access to data and functionality 
- A native social environment that allows you to interact with people or data 
- Built-in security for protecting data and defining access across your organization 
- Multiple APIs to integrate with external systems 
- The ability to install or create packaged apps   

This workbook shows you how to use, configure, and develop the Salesforce1 mobile app in a series of tutorials. Initially you create a very simple app to track your learning progress, which is enough to show you the basics. If you following along to the end of this tutorial, you’ll also install a Warehouse app that will help you learn more sophisticated examples with code.
