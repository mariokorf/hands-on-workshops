##Tutorial 1: Initial Set Up##

The first thing you need to do is set up your development and testing environment. Then you’ll set up your browser and mobile device for testing.

###Step 1: Get a New DE Org###

If you already have a Developer Edition org, you might not need a new one. However, if you’ve previously done any tutorials with the Warehouse app, the advanced section at the end of this workbook uses this app, and there might be a conflict when installing the package. While you might be able to navigate around potential conflicts, it’s easier and faster to create a new org. In addition, Developer Edition orgs created before the Winter ‘14 release don’t some necessary functionality.

1. **In your browser, go to ****http://bit.ly/s1gettingstarted****. **
2. **Fill in the fields about yourself. **
3. **In the ****Email Address ****field, make sure to use a public address you can easily check from a Web browser right now. **
4. **Type a unique ****Username ****like ****firstname.lastname@s1workshop.com****. **
5. **Read and then select the checkbox for the ****Master Subscription Agreement****. and then click Submit Registration. **
6. **In a moment you’ll receive an email with a login link. Click the link and change your password. **

**Step 2: Create an App**

To understand how to access custom apps in the Salesforce1 mobile app, you need to create an app. Use the App Quick Start wizard to create an app that will help you track your learning progress.

1. **On the Force.com Setup page, click the green Add App button. **
2. **Fill in the form as follows: **
    - **For the App type ****Learn Salesforce1 ****. **
    - **For the Label, type ****Lesson****. **
    - **For the Plural Label, type ****Lessons****. **

3. **Click Create and once the wizard finishes, click Go To My App and then Start Tour, to get a quick overview of your app's interface. **
4. **Click New to create a new Lesson. Name it ****Use Mobile App ****and then click Save. **

**Step 3: Download the Salesforce1 Mobile App**

For final testing, you’ll also need to install the Salesforce1 mobile app on your device. If you’ve already downloaded the Salesforce1 mobile app, you can skip this step.

**Note: **If you’re already using the Salesforce1 mobile app, you can skip this section. Note that you’ll have to log out of the mobile app and log back in with the credentials of your new org.

1. **Useyourmobiledevice’sbrowsertogoto****www.salesforce.com/mobile****,selecttheappropriateplatform,anddownload Salesforce1. **
2. **Open Salesforce1 from your mobile device. **
3. **Enter the login credentials from your new org and tap Log in to Salesforce. **

1. **If this is the first time using the Salesforce1 mobile app, the phone prompts you to email a verification code. Tap the button, check your email, and copy the verification code into the space provided. **
2. **Tap Verify my code and log me in, and then tap Allow so that the app can access to your data. **
3. **Swipe through the introductory screens and then tap Get Started. **
