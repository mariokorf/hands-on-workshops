hands-on-workshops
==================
Hands-on workshops are short tutorials we use at Dreamforce in the Developer Zone. These tutorials resemble exercises from the Force.com Workbook and Elevate series. Typically hands-on workshop start with a 10-minute slide presentation that introduces the tutorial, followed by 40 minutes of exercises, and then 10 minutes break between the next session. (60 minutes total). 

#Influitive Challenge#
This year we are opening up the workshop topics to ideas from our community. 
* What did you find challenging when you first started developing for Salesforce? 
* What are some of your best practices? 
* What tools and processes do you use to make things easier? 

Write up a tutorial and submit it. We'll help with the editing and publishing. You'll get points for every contribution, more if we use your tutorial. Some tutorials may even get into our popular Workbook series. 

If you have an idea for a workshop that is shorter than 40 minutes, no problem. We may try and fit some shorter workshops this year: 5-minute slides and intro, 20 minutes of hands-on tutorial, and 5 minutes of break between sessions. Or we might merge some shorter workshops into a larger one. Either way, don't let the length of the workshop restrict what you want to teach. We'll make it work out. 

#Partners#
Salesforce Partners are also welcome to submit workshops. The guidelines for creating content and presentations are the same, however you must provide a presenter and two staff members to assist customers. 


#Guidelines#
* In general, you should emulate the style of the [Force.com Workbook](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.workbook.meta/workbook/create_app_1.htm). 
* Use the standard objects and data that comes in Developer Edition: Accounts, Contacts, etc. If the tutorial scenario absolutely requires custom objects or data, make a case for it. If your custom objects can use the Warehouse schema, so much the better. 
* Design around 30 or 60 minutes of hands-on material. Partners must use 30 minutes (5 minutes slides, 20 minutes hands-on, 5 minutes between sessions).
* Author in Markdown (we’ll publish in GitBook); do slides as a Google Presentation. If this is a problem, share a Google doc with me (mario.korf@gmail.com) and I'll tag it in Markdown. 
* Update this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IJX-_5f6sT04XKLluIglWK8PWDwk5ERZiACYPrJC7DA/edit#gid=0) so everyone knows who’s doing what. There is a separate tab for Partners. 
* Have your submissions in by Sept 15th so we have time to edit, approve, and get comments back to you. Partners may get a slightly later date, as we'll have a smaller print run. 

##Presentations##
The slide show that precedes the workshop is usually very basic, just a couple screen shots and some speaker notes so that the presenter can introduce the scope and flow of your tutorial. If you are going to be at Dreamforce and want to present your own workshop, let us know! There will be some logistics so that we can fit your schedule into the workshop schedule. It is assumed Partners will bring their own staff for the workshops.

A sample slide deck is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UBujKdJGa8IS7QxlOHuucfA-BuYSPDYxZGS7856WrfE/edit?usp=sharing).


##Workshop Ideas##
Think about what you needed help with when you first started using Salesforce and Force.com. Here are some ideas for hands-on workshops that we’ve never done. 

* Going in-depth into SOQL and SOSL 
* Developer Tools, such as Force.com IDE and/or Workbench
* Using the Data Loader
* How to use Flows 
* More with analytics
* Service Cloud something or other 
* Something with Heroku (extra points)
