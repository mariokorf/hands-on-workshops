hands-on-workshops
==================
Hands-on workshops are short tutorials we use at Dreamforce in the Developer Zone. These tutorials resemble exercises from the Force.com Workbook and Elevate series. Typically hands-on workshop start with a 10-minute slide presentation that introduces the tutorial, followed by 40 minutes of exercises, and then 10 minutes break between the next session. (60 minutes total). 

#Influitive Challenge#
This year we are opening up the workshop topics to ideas from our community. 
* What did you find challenging when you first started developing for Salesforce? 
* What are some of your best practices? 
* What tools and processes do you use to make things easier? 

Write up a tutorial and submit it. We'll help with the editing and publishing. You'll get points for every contribution, more if we use your tutorial. Some tutorials may even get into our popular Workbook series. 

If you have an idea for a workshop that is shorter than 40 minutes, no problem. We may try and fit some shorter workshops this year: 5-minute slides and intro, 20 minutes of hands-on tutorial, and 5 minutes of break between sessions. Or we might merge some shorter workshops into a larger one. Either way, don't let the length of the workshop restrict what you want to teach. We'll make it work out. 

##Guidelines##
* Emulate the style of the [Force.com Workbook](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.workbook.meta/workbook/create_app_1.htm). 
* Use the standard objects and data that comes in Developer Edition: Accounts, Contacts, etc. If the tutorial scenario absolutely requires custom objects or data, make a case for it. If your custom objects can use the Warehouse schema, so much the better. 
* Design around 20 or 40 minutes of hands-on material, but don't sweat the details too much. 
* Author in Markdown (we’ll publish in GitBook); do slides as a Google Presentation. 
* Update this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IJX-_5f6sT04XKLluIglWK8PWDwk5ERZiACYPrJC7DA/edit#gid=0) so everyone knows who’s doing what.
* Have your submissions in by Sept 15th so we have time to edit, approve, and get comments back to you. 

###Presentations##
The slide show that precedes the workshop is usually very basic, just a couple screen shots and some speaker notes so that the presenter can introduce the scope and flow of your tutorial. If you are going to be at Dreamforce and want to present your own workshop, let us know! There will be some logistics so that we can fit your schedule into the workshop schedule, but there will be some extra incentive points for you!  

A sample slide deck is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UBujKdJGa8IS7QxlOHuucfA-BuYSPDYxZGS7856WrfE/edit?usp=sharing).


##Workshop Ideas##
Think about what you needed help with when you first started using Salesforce and Force.com. Here are some ideas for hands-on workshops that we’ve never done. 

* Going in-depth into SOQL and SOSL 
* Developer Tools, such as Force.com IDE and/or Workbench
* Using the Data Loader
* How to use Flows 
* More with analytics
* Service Cloud something or other 
* Something with Heroku (extra points)
